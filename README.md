### welcome!
workingoffbroadway.org is the home for those who work backstage in new york city, outside of broadway theaters.  
  
if you work in lighting at a LORT venue,  
in wardrobe at a not-for-profit house,  
in carpentry for a commercial off-broadway production,   
audio for a pop-up immersive experience,  
in scenic paint at a roller disco,   
or stitch for themed entertainment, **we want to hear from you.**

### landed a new job as crew?  
you should be sure you're working as an employee.   
employers often try to misclassify workers as independent contractors, using the W9 form.  
if your employer sets your schedule, **you should onboard on a W-4, to later receive from your employer a W-2.**  
being an employee means you have rights to minimum wage, breaks, overtime, and collective bargaining.  
[you can read more about being misclassified here.](https://www.wnylabortoday.com/news/2023/04/23/labor-news-from-washington-d.c./employer-misclassification-of-workers-as-independent-contractors-robs-workers-new-economic-policy-institute-analysis-estimates-the-economic-costs-of-misclassifying-workers-as-independent-contractors/)  

### witnessed a safety issue at work?  
[federal law entitles workers to a safe workplace.](https://www.osha.gov/workers)  
if you perceive a safety issue in your live performance workplace, in addition to following your employer's hazard reporting plan,   
you can also report the hazard to the IA Safety hotline.  
844-422-9273, regardless of your union afiliation. 

### how much should i expect to be paid?  
rates vary for different departments and different positions at different venues.  
the 'floor' for off-broadway technicians is commonly $30/hr in 2024. you should aim higher. *why?*

as of 2024, the [economic policy institute family budget calculator](https://www.epi.org/resources/budget/) says that a single person with no children in New York County (that's Manhattan, where most of the theaters are) needs to make $78,454 annually to attain a 'modest yet adequate standard of living'. that's around $1569.08/wk or $39.23/hr, assuming you work 50 weeks per year, 40 hours per week. it could also be calculated as $1508.73/wk, around $37.72 if you work all 52 weeks.  

entry level theater positions in new york city do not pay $37+/hr.   
if the opportunity presents itself to negotiate your hourly wage, do not compromise on your wages because of the perceived reputation of the venue.  

playbill credits don't feed you, pay your rent, or pay for healthcare. money does.
